                An About Us page is a section on a website that provides information about a company, organization, or individual. It is an opportunity to tell your brand's story, share your vision, history, values, and achievements, and introduce team members. This is where you build trust and credibility with customers.


                Going along with the same storytelling theme, BRADY capitalizes on the effect that telling a story—with its own angle and personality—can create for a brand. 

Everything on its About Us page—from the simple black-and-white format to the images—screams quality and innovation. As you craft your About Us story, consider infusing it with your brand personality by using different branding elements. Bonus points if you can sprinkle in reasons why your customers should trust your brand over others. BRADY does this by stating its focus is on producing the world’s “finest performance brand.” 

Do the same and your About Us page has already done half its job.

BRADY’s About Us page goes on to explain why it’s valuable: “Our fabrics and materials fuse natural elements with cutting-edge technology. Designed with the body in mind.”
4. Bossy Cosmetics
Bossy Cosmetics’ About Us page takes a more traditional approach, with plenty of text. Yet what’s worth noting is that it sets the picture of its founder front and center.

The founder is an integral part of the brand’s origin story, so making her the star of the page works. Think about including additional elements, like Bossy has, that can strengthen your About Us page, such as:

Brand-related Instagram posts
A welcome YouTube video
Links to partner charities and brands
Pictures of customers using your product
Interactive timelines that show company milestones
When you craft your About page, don’t forgo creativity for the sake of being professional, especially if that isn’t a value your brand stands for. What matters is that your brand is relatable to its target audience and meets them where they’re at.

5. Allbirds
Allbirds’ brilliant use of elements like background videos and quippy phrases to draw in its audience’s attention already make its About Us page that much more memorable. Scroll further and you’re met with a founder's story, told in the third person.

While this approach can work, be careful not to sound too stiff and unrelatable. To balance that, Allbirds uses simple copy and puts a face with a name by including images of its founders. 

Consider using animation to show instead of tell how your product comes together. Add an easy-to-skim description of how your product stands out from the rest for some additional context.

6. Buck Mason
Buck Mason—a menswear brand—doesn’t shy away from images to showcase the soul and origins of its California roots. It’s a great example of how you can use visuals to tell your story and create a brand identity that goes beyond the usual wall of text. 

One of the best parts of Buck Mason’s About Us page? Its calls to action (CTAs): “Come have a drink” and “Stop on by.” They’re relatable and playful, and they sound like their target audience. 

Don’t ignore your CTA as a key part of your About Us page that can add to your brand identity. It’s an opportunity to convey what your brand is all about.
